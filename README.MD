# Apollo Sample Application

DataStax released Apollo Open Beta on October 9th ! To try it let's go to [http://apollo.datastax.com](http://apollo.datastax.com) and create your account.

## 1. Create the Database in Apollo 

- Select the *Create a DataBase* Button
- Chosse a name for your database (it will not be used later to initiate connection)
- Chosse a name for your Keyspace (no space please) in the screenshot I chose `demo_apollo`
- Select database sizing
- Launch database creation

It will take about 20 to 30 minutes to initialize, we are creating a full working 3 nodes cluster after all. You can go and grab a cup of coffee or start pulling the source code of this demo in the mean time. Well the screen should look like:

Once the Database is ready you will receive a confirmation email. 
This is database will live for 72 hours and will be then terminated for you.

## 2. Browsing in Constellation

Boom ! Database is ready let's login to Constellation and explore a bit. Look at `actions` you can do on your Database. You can connect to DataStax Studio (service #2 in Constellation after Apollo)

Start working with the notebook *Working with CQL in the Cloud* provided for you.

A pop up will appears asking you for your credentials, this is expected. You need to login to service DataStax Studio. Use the same credentials you entered to create your db.

You will execute some cells to define tables like `videos` and insert data into it

Now back to the home page, in the `action` button select `Download your connection details`. This will download a bundle as a zip file, save it somewhere we will need it to connect the application. Let's call this file the bundle.

Ok let's get our hands dirty on your laptop

## 3. Starting the app.

To run the application you need *Maven* and *Java8+*. Here is the installation procedure 

a. Clone the repository 

```
git clone https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/sample-webapp-apollo.git
```

b. Access the folder you just created

```
cd sample-webapp-apollo
```

c. Locate the file `application.yaml` in the folder `src/main/resources` and edit the connection information to connect to your instance

```
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Connectivity to Constellation Apollo
# ----------------------------------------------------------
constellation:
  apollo:
    username: cedrick
    password: cedrick
    keyspace: demo_apollo
    zipfile: src/main/resources/connection-apollo-demo.zip
```

As you can see I copied my zip file in `src/main/resources` but you can also reference a complete path on the disk.

d. You start the application by executing the following command at root level of your project 

```
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

Open your browser on `http://localhost:8080`:

- First Screen will list dome details about your cluster. As you can see this a 3 nodes cluster

<img src="https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/sample-webapp-apollo/blob/master/images/12.png" /> 

- Second screen will list your keyspaces (single one here)

<img src="https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/sample-webapp-apollo/blob/master/images/13.png" /> 

- Select the keyspace by clicking, This will list the tables available in the keyspace

<img src="https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/sample-webapp-apollo/blob/master/images/14.png" /> 

- Chose `videos` for instance (should be created by the cell in DataStax studio)

<img src="https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/sample-webapp-apollo/blob/master/images/15.png" /> 

- You have some text to execute Queries. Run query with `EXECUTE` button

## Et VOILA !
